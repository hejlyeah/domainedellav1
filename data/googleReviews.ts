    text: "Our visit to Domaine Della was nothing short of spectacular! From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warmth and hospitality by David Hejl and Mary, who made us feel like family.\n\nThe wines were simply exquisite. Each sip was well balanced, and complex, showcasing the artistry and precision that make Domaine Della \"WICKED JUICE!\". The Pinot Noir was rich and elegant, while the Chardonnay had the perfect harmony of butteryness and structure. Every pour told a story of craftsmanship and dedication.\n\nBeyond the wines, the atmosphere was intimate and inviting. David and Mary's generosity, knowledge, and enthusiasm elevated the experience, making it one we will never forget. We left with not only a deeper appreciation for fine wine but also a lasting memory of a truly special day.\n\nThank you, David and Mary, for such an unforgettable experience! We can't wait to return and savor more of your phenomenal wines. Domaine Della is a must-visit for any wine lover! üç∑‚ú®",

Domaine Della is a diamond in the rough with some of the most haunting flavors you will experience in Sonoma County or anywhere for that matter.  Not only are Dave and Mary phenomenal winemakers, they are great people.  We look forward to enjoying their wines for YEARS to come.  See you at harvest!!!",

Fantastic people and some of the best Pinot Noir and Chardonnay to be found in California.  They do not make a bad wine.  Big bold wines that still remain true to their appellation and or the Vineyard.   Do yourself a favor and get their mailing list while you still can!",

Mary's hospitality and charm complement the experience. And best of all are David's wines. Each is a great expression of the fruit and terroir.

David captained us through a voyage of vino including his fantastic rose (new this year!), Chardonnay, and finally a crescendo of electrifying Pinot Noirs.\n\nHis description of the wine making process, and the work that goes into each individual blend and bottle brought the whole message home. His passion for his craft is undeniable, and completely infectious.\n\nTo call out my highlights: The Russian River Pinot Noir is a personal favorite (and of course seductive as ever). We were also treated to some delicious Terra Di Promissio, and to take the cake we finished on 4 Amours. A special thank you to Mary for keeping us well fed - The accompanying food selection was a delight - Its very hard to find a chocolate good enough to go with Domaine Della, but she managed it!!\n\nFinally our hosts sorted us out for dinner plans (where we had been slightly lagging on booking) and sent us off to Willi's wine bar in Sonoma.\n\nIn summary, if you're in the Sonoma area you would be silly to not sample some \"Della Delicious\" as we call it at home. If you choose not to, then its your loss - More for me.",

    text: "Highly recommend tasting at Domaine Della.  Their passion for their craft is evident, as all of their wines are excellent.  David and Mary  very generously poured well over a dozen wines, and it is impossible to choose one favorite.  But if I could only have 1, I'd choose 4 Amours in the wooden 4 pack crate as beautiful and elegant as the wine inside.  Their hospitality and willingness to share all of their knowledge and experience extended into an impromptu dinner out together that we will never forget and was echoed by wine makers at our other tastings who said things like David had taught one of his best classes in som school and another who said he was the mentor who not only helped him launch his own winery but who continues to share advice and guidance any time he asks.  We will definitely be back during our next trip this fall!",

However, everything changed when we met David and Mary. Their extraordinary selection of Pinot Noir wines captivated us all, unanimously earning the title of our group's favorite. Even though our tasting was in a warehouse setting, any initial reservations were quickly forgotten once we began savoring the exceptional Pinots, paired with the warm and thoughtful hospitality of our hosts. David and Mary didn't just serve us wine; they served us an experience that won't be easily forgotten. Highly recommend for any wine enthusiast looking for both quality and character in Sonoma!",

It was clear the owner's passion for pinot noir and his love of wine.  We just opened a bottle of the 2018 4 Amours that we ordered as well as a 1964 bottle of Gaja Barbaresco my husband opened for a birthday celebration with family, and we decided to forego the Gaja and drink more of the 4 Amours.  It is excellent!  Thank you for the incredible wine. We hope to enjoy Domaine Della for years to come.",

David, the owner & wine maker, along with Mary, who presented a beautiful charcuterie board paired thoughtfully and elegantly with the wines, gave us an exceptional experience. David provided tastings of his Chardonnays, Pinot blends and single vineyard Pinots. His knowledge of wine that he shared is fascinating and enhanced the generous tastings he provided. We love Domaine Della's delicious wines and we are looking forward to sharing David's wines with friends. Thank you David and Mary for a wonderful and fun experience!

During our relaxed and enjoyable 2 hour tasting we sampled all the wines in their current portfolio - including the recently bottled '21's which were terrific.
