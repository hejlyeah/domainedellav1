# DOMAINE DELLA PROJECT OVERVIEW

## üåü Introduction

The Domaine Della website is a sophisticated, modern web application built with Next.js 15.2.2 and React 19. It serves as a premium digital presence for a winery, offering an immersive experience for wine enthusiasts, collectors, and customers. The application combines cutting-edge web technologies with elegant design to create a seamless, responsive, and engaging user experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Architecture

The application follows a modern, component-based architecture leveraging the power of Next.js App Router and React 19's latest features:

- **Next.js App Router**: Utilizes the file-system based routing structure with app directory
- **Server Components**: Leverages React Server Components for improved performance and SEO
- **Client Components**: Uses client-side interactivity where needed for dynamic user experiences
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Combines static generation, server-side rendering, and client-side rendering as appropriate

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Integrated E-commerce**: Custom e-commerce functionality built directly into the Next.js application
2. **Context-based State Management**: React Context API for global state management
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for core web vitals and user experience

## üöÄ Initialization Sequence

The application follows a sophisticated initialization sequence:

1. **Next.js Bootstrap**:
   - Next.js initializes the application environment
   - Loads configuration from `next.config.mjs`
   - Sets up experimental features (webpackBuildWorker, parallelServerBuildTraces, parallelServerCompiles)

2. **Root Layout Initialization**:
   - Loads the Inter font from Google Fonts
   - Sets up meta tags and viewport settings
   - Initializes the header height CSS variable via a beforeInteractive script
   - Mounts the ScrollToTop component for improved navigation

3. **Component Tree Mounting**:
   - Renders the page-specific components based on the current route
   - Loads the SiteFooter component globally

4. **E-Cellar Integration**:
   - Initializes the e-commerce functionality
   - Connects to the eCellar API for wine sales and allocation management
